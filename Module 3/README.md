# Code Samples - Module 3: Managing Legacy Code

This folder contains individual code samples from Module 3 of the course. They illustrate strategies for understanding, refactoring, and gradually improving unstructured or outdated codebases.

These samples are provided *out of context* for review and practice. In the ONF course, all of these topics are introduced step by step, explained in detail, and supported with work requirements for hands-on experience.
