# Code Samples - Module 6: Containerization and Collaborative Development Practices

This folder contains individual code samples from Module 6 of the course. They demonstrate basic containerization using Docker and practical collaboration workflows using Git and GitHub.

These samples are provided *out of context* for review and practice. In the ONF course, all topics are introduced step by step, explained in context, and connected to earlier work on software architecture, APIs, and testing, with accompanying exercises and project requirements.
