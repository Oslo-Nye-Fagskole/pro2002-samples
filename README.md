# PRO2002 Software Architecture and Design Patterns â€“ Code Samples

This repository contains code samples from the course **PRO2002 Software Architecture and Design Patterns**.

The examples are intentionally small and focused, illustrating specific concepts such as object-oriented programming, SOLID principles, design patterns, and software architecture.  

They are provided *out of context* here for educational purposes, but in the course they are tied to the learning material and set in context with theory and practice.  

Feel free to browse, fork, and adapt the material as part of your own learning journey.

Good luck and have fun ðŸ˜Š
