# Code Samples - Module 2: Common Design Patterns and Architectures

This folder contains individual code samples from Module 2 of the course. They demonstrate some of the most widely used design patterns including Factory, Singleton, Strategy, and Observer, as well as additional architectural principles.

These samples are provided *out of context* for review and practice. In the ONF course, all of the topics are introduced step by step, explained in detail, and supported with work requirements for hands-on experience.
