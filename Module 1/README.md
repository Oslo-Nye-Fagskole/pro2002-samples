# Code Samples - Module 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID Principles

This folder contains individual code samples from Module 1 of the course. They demonstrate key object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, as well as the SOLID principles for designing maintainable and extensible software.

These samples are provided *out of context* for review and practice. In the course, each concept is introduced step by step, explained in detail, and supported with work requirements for hands-on experience.
