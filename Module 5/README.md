# Code Samples - Module 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

This folder contains individual code samples from Module 5 of the course. They demonstrate how to write and structure tests for Python code, focusing on tests that provide fast feedback and fit naturally into everyday development workflows.

These samples are provided *out of context* for review and practice. In the ONF course, all of these topics are introduced step by step, explained in detail, and supported with work requirements for hands-on experience.
