# Code Samples - Module 4: Building Robust RESTful APIs

This folder contains individual code samples from Module 4 of the course. They demonstrate how RESTful design principles are applied in practice using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), from defining routes and handling requests to implementing secure, persistent, and maintainable APIs.

These samples are provided *out of context* for review and practice. In the ONF course, all of these topics are introduced step by step, explained in detail, and supported with work requirements for hands-on experience.
