# Shop API v1

- v1 containing mock data
- **No** database integration
- **No** authentication/authorization

## Run instructions

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

Once running, open your browser and go to:
- [http://localhost:5000/products](http://localhost:5000/products)
- [http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/p-1001](http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/p-1001)

To update an existing product, send a PUT request with JSON data to `/products/<product_id>`:

```
PUT /products/p-1001
Content-Type: application/json
{
"price": 429.0,
"in_stock": false
}
```

To delete a product, send a DELETE request:
```
DELETE /products/p-1001
```

Both operations return appropriate HTTP status codes (**200** for update, **204** for delete) confirming successful completion. To view and confirm the changes above, access the full product list after each to see the difference.
